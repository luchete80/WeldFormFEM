|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|

### **INDUSTRIAL**

| **Feature**              | **FORGE** (Transvalor)       | **Simufact** (MSC)          | **DEFORM** (SFTC)            | **Computational Cost** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Base Method**          | **Modified F-bar** + Selective integration | **Nodal Pressure Averaging** + Nonlinear viscosity | **Stabilized SSRI** |
| **F-bar Usage**          | Yes (with `α → 0.2` in plasticity) | No (uses nodal averaging) | No (selective integration) | |
| **J Treatment**          | `J_bar = α·J_local + (1-α)·J_avg` (adaptive α) | `J_nodal = avg(J_neighbors)` | `J_dev` integrated at 4 points, `J_vol` at 1 point | |
| **Stabilization**        | Quadratic viscosity + Geometric correction | Nonlinear viscosity (`q ~ ρ·c·ε̇²`) | Laplacian stress filter (every 5 steps) | |
| **Hourglassing**         | No (only in elastic phase)  | No                        | No                        | |
| **Contact Handling**     | Stiffness correction in contact zones | Increased viscosity in contact | Adaptive nodal averaging | |
| **Main Advantage**       | Excellent for hot forging (large deformations) | Stability with irregular meshes | Precision in contact surfaces | |
| **Limitation**           | Requires α calibration      | Over-smooths stresses      | High computational cost   | |
| **Key Reference**        | FORGE Theory Manual (Sec. 5.2) | Simufact Technical Papers (Wu, 2019) | DEFORM V11 User Manual | |
| **Computational Cost**   | **Medium** (adaptive α + mixed integration) | **Low-Medium** (averaging + nonlinear viscosity) | **High** (full SSRI + filtering) |

### Key Notes:
1. **FORGE** uses a hybrid approach with adaptive F-bar for elasticity and selective integration for plasticity.
2. **Simufact** relies on nodal averaging rather than F-bar, making it more stable for irregular meshes but potentially over-smoothing stresses.
3. **DEFORM** uses SSRI which is computationally intensive but provides excellent contact precision.
