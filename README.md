#WeldFormFEM ‚Äì Open-Source FEM Solver for Large Deformation Processes

WeldFormFEM is an open-source Finite Element solver designed for nonlinear solid mechanics simulations 
involving large deformations, contact, and material plasticity.

Originally developed for forging simulations, the solver is modular and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of forming and manufacturing processes such as:

Forging

Extrusion and stamping

Indentation and hardness tests

Solid mechanics under large strains

Custom research on material behavior

üí° Key Features
‚úÖ Explicit dynamic integration

‚úÖ Plasticity and large deformation support

‚úÖ Remeshing for element quality preservation

‚úÖ Graphical User Interface (GUI) in active development

‚úÖ Written in C++, with clean modular design

‚öôÔ∏è Integration with VTK, OpenCascade, and other libraries

üß™ Ideal for experimentation, research, and education

üß± Use cases
Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or student, WeldFormFEM offers a sandbox for developing and understanding FEM solvers tailored to high-deformation processes. New capabilities like remeshing, GUI-based workflows, and scripting are actively being developed.




# WeldFormFEM
Updated Lagrangian Explicit Finite Element Method (FEM) CPU/GPU based solver. \
WeldFormFEM is aimed to solve solid mechanics large strain problems, such as metal forming. \
The idea is to work via 2 different solvers:
1 - Pure lagrangian with rezoning (adaptive mesh refinement or AMR), Work In Progress as first option \
2 - Coupled Eulerian (fixed mesh or Arbitrarian Eulerian Lagrangian) Lagrangian solver based on Benson works. \
WeldFormFEM works both on Ubuntu and Windows.
you can select to build it to CPU and GPU only by changing a single CMAKE var.

| Feature         | **Density**                                             | **Pointwise**                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Controls the global mesh density, used for element size adjustment across the entire mesh. | Defines a more localized mesh refinement, typically used for adapting based on certain criteria (e.g., features or user-defined conditions). |
| **Usage**       | Typically used to control mesh coarseness or refinement globally, usually through tags like "density" to apply a global criterion for mesh density. | Used for more detailed control, typically in localized regions or based on features in the mesh, allowing for finer resolution in specific areas. |
| **Method**      | A global parameter that can influence the entire mesh structure based on a density tag. | Localized refinements applied to the mesh based on specific criteria (e.g., pointwise data). |
| **Application** | Mesh refinement across the entire mesh; can be used to prevent overly large elements and ensure smoother transitions. | Localized refinement; commonly used to refine areas of interest such as regions with high gradients, features, or areas requiring higher accuracy. |
| **Example**     | "mesh.add_tag(VERT, 'density', 1, Reals(mesh.nelems(), 1.0));" | "mesh.add_tag(VERT, 'pointwise', 1, Reals(mesh.nverts(), some_local_condition));" |
| **Effect**      | Affects mesh element size globally (entire mesh can get finer or coarser depending on density values). | Affects only specified points or elements based on conditions, like features, threshold values, or other user-defined criteria. |
